## 🚀 Key Features

- **📊 Live AQI Prediction**  
  Uses a **Random Forest model** to predict the current Air Quality Index (AQI) based on real-time pollutant data.

- **⏳ 72-Hour Air Quality Forecast**  
  A **LightGBM time-series model** provides a 72-hour forecast of future air quality trends.

- **🌍 Dynamic Dashboard**  
  An interactive dashboard with a **Folium map** visualizes current AQI markers and animated heatmaps for future forecasts.

- **💧 Water Quality Monitoring**  
  Placeholder feature – will use a **regression model** to predict water quality in future updates.

- **🤖 Chatbot Assistant**  
  A semi-advanced, **rule-based chatbot** helps users understand AQI categories and pollutant definitions.
